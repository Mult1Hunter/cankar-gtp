# Design brief (the architect step)

Post this brief in-chat BEFORE writing the code. It exists because foresight
failures are this project's dominant defect class (ADR 0006: a bibliography
detector shipped against synthetic tests and amputated ~150 poems - one
enumeration question would have caught it).

## The brief (~10 lines, no ceremony)

1. **Goal** - one sentence.
2. **Inputs/outputs** - types, schemas, where artifacts land.
3. **Data classes** - ENUMERATE every kind of input this code will meet
   (for corpus text: prose, verse, drama, catalogs/indexes, OCR noise,
   mixed-language, ...). This line is the whole point: name the class you
   have not thought about yet.
4. **Failure modes + blast radius** - what breaks if this is wrong, and what
   it contaminates downstream (e.g. misattribution poisons the style
   classifier).
5. **Placement** - which stage subpackage/scripts dir (ADR 0005); what
   existing code it reuses.
6. **Validation plan** - what proves it works BEFORE it ships. Heuristics and
   thresholds: the calibration rule (ADR 0006) applies - labeled REAL examples
   of every enumerated class, which then become regression fixtures.
7. **Out of scope** - what this deliberately does not handle, recorded.

## Architect critique (new-subsystem scale)

For phase kickoffs, new pipeline stages, or anything establishing a pattern
others will follow: after drafting the brief, spawn a Plan/architect agent to
challenge it (fresh eyes, read-only) and address its must-fix points before
implementing. Solo-file changes inside an established pattern do not need the
agent - the brief alone suffices.

## Decision triggers (reach for the pattern PROACTIVELY)

| When you see | Reach for |
|---|---|
| a closed set of string values | StrEnum (serialization stays plain strings) |
| a dict with fixed magic keys | dataclass (frozen if value-like) or pydantic model |
| a SECOND similar implementation | protocol/shared abstraction - or a written deferral |
| branching on a type/kind string | polymorphism via protocol dispatch |
| a boolean parameter that switches behavior | two functions, or an enum mode |
| raw dict access into config/TOML/JSON | a validated pydantic model at the boundary |
| a magic number in logic | named constant; calibration provenance if it is a threshold (ADR 0006) |
| I/O + policy + formatting in one function | split by altitude |
| error signaling via exit/print in a module | domain exception (core/errors.py) + logging |
| a relative path literal | core/paths.py helper |

Counterweight: patterns must earn their existence - no protocols with one
implementer, no config for constants. Rule of two, not rule of maybe-someday.

Written deferrals live as ROADMAP items (status home), not in this skill.

## Exemptions

Config tweaks, doc edits, mechanical renames, changes fully covered by an
existing brief. When in doubt, write the brief - it costs a minute.
