> *Mati, ali je model že konvergiral?*

A Slovene micro language model (~40M parameters) trained **from scratch** - custom BPE
tokenizer, pretraining on public-domain Slovenian literature and Wikipedia, then
specialized in the prose voice of **Ivan Cankar** (1876-1918), with a plain->Cankar
style-transfer stage trained on synthetic parallel data.

**Status:** Phase 1 (corpus building). See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full
plan, risk register, and budget (spoiler: the whole thing costs about one dinner in
Ljubljana).

## Why from scratch, when GaMS exists?

Deliberately both, in order: the from-scratch model demonstrates the full stack
(tokenizer -> pretraining -> SFT -> serving) on consumer/rented hardware; a later
GaMS fine-tune on the same dataset demonstrates practical delivery with modern
open models. One project, two claims. Details in the roadmap.

## Reproducing

Corpus-building scripts are published here (the merged corpus itself is not
redistributed - licensing note in ROADMAP Phase 1):

```bash
uv sync
uv run scripts/corpus/crawl_wikivir.py --category "Kategorija:Ivan Cankar" \
    --out data/corpus/cankar.jsonl
```

## Data sources and attribution

Training text comes from public sources; per-document provenance (source URL,
identifiers, retrieval metadata) is recorded in the works registry (`registry/`)
and shard manifests:

- **Wikivir / Slovene Wikisource** (sl.wikisource.org) - hand-transcribed
  public-domain literature, courtesy of the Wikisource contributor community.
- **Digitalna knjiznica Slovenije - dLib.si** (National and University Library
  of Slovenia) - digitized public-domain editions. Only works carrying dLib's
  public-domain rights mark are ingested, and dLib.si is cited here as their
  source, per the dLib terms of use.
- **Wikipedia (Slovenian)** - planned; text is CC BY-SA, attributed to Wikipedia
  contributors.

The merged training corpus is **not redistributed** (CC BY-SA share-alike vs.
public-domain mixing - see ROADMAP Phase 1). Any published artifact built from
this data (HF datasets, model cards, demo pages) repeats these credits.

## License

Code is [MIT](LICENSE). The merged training corpus is not redistributed; model
weights will be licensed at Hugging Face release time.
