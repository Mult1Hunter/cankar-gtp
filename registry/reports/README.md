# registry/reports/ - machine-owned, generated

Two report classes live here (marker line names the class):

- **drift-checked** (coverage-*.md, collisions.md): regenerated
  byte-identically by `cankar corpus report --all`; CI diff-checks them.
- **snapshot** (corpus-quality.md, near-duplicates.md, dlib-reconcile.md,
  merge.md, tokenizer-eval.md, chunks.md, token-stats.md, eval-holdout.md):
  computed from gitignored data/ or live dLib state by `cankar corpus stats` /
  `dedup` / `reconcile-dlib` / `merge` / `cankar tokenizer eval` / `chunk` /
  `stats` / `cankar evals holdout-freeze`; CI cannot regenerate them - do NOT
  fold them into `report --all` or the drift gate goes red.

Every file starts with a GENERATED marker. Hand edits are overwritten (and
fail CI for the drift-checked class). Human annotations belong in
../works/NOTES.md.
